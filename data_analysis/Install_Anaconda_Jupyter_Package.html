    <h1>1. How to download and install Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook?</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Download Anaconda</h2>
    <p>Navigate to the Anaconda website to download and install the app at <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download">https://www.anaconda.com/download</a>. If you are a Mac user, please download the appropriate version (Intel or M1/M2).</p>

    <p>Anaconda is an open-source package and environment management system for Python programming language. It is designed to simplify the process of installing, managing, and working with data science libraries, packages, and environments.</p>

    <p>Please follow the video if you have issues downloading and installing Anaconda at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUeBzT43JyY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUeBzT43JyY</a>.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Install and Launch Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda</h2>
    <p>Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its applications include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.</p>
    <p>We will use Jupyter Notebook to write Python code for web data collection. </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Create a new Python "ipynb" file on Jupyter Notebook</h2>
    <p> Click on "New" and "Python 3(ipykernel)" under a folder where you can locate to write and run Python code. </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Write Python code on the file</h2>
    <p> Click on "+" to add a cell, write a simple code by typing "print("hello")", and click on "Run" to run the code line. </p>

    <h1>2. How to install Python packages or libraries for use in Jupyter notebook with Anaconda?</h1>
    <p>Python a library is just a collection of modules. A module is a single file that contains Python code, meant to be imported and used by other Python code. For example, the Python library "Pandas" provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures like the DataFrame, and data analysis tools.
    <h2>Step 1: Launch Anaconda Navigator and click on the "Environments" tab located on the left side of the window.</h2>
    <h2>Step 2: Select the specific Python environment where you want to install the library. For instance, let's assume we are using the "python3916" environment. If you have just installed Anaconda, you might only see one Python environment named "base (root)".</h2>
    <h2>Step 3: To search for a library, make sure the "All" option is selected in the drop-down menu next to the search bar. Enter the name of the library you want to install, for example, "bs4" for the BeautifulSoup library used for web scraping.</h2>
    <h2>Step 4: The search results will display the library you searched for. To install the library, check the box next to its name. </h2>

    <h2>Step 5: Click on the "Apply" button located at the bottom right corner of the Anaconda Navigator window.</h2>

<p>Anaconda will initiate the installation process, and the selected library will be downloaded and installed into your chosen Python environment.</p>

    <h1>2.1. Alternative: Using Terminal to install Python libraries on Anaconda for Jupyter Notebook</h1>
    <h2>Step1: Open Terminal</h2>

    <h2>Step3: Type "conda activate" + your environment name to Activate the environment where you want to install the package. </h2>

    <h2>Now, your package has been successfully installed.</h2>

    <h2>2.2. Follow the installation instruction provided above to install two packages needed for web data collection: 1) bs4 and 2) requests </h2>
